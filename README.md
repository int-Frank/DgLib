# DgLib

A collection of useful things I use across most of my projects. The library includes:

  - 2D/3D vector and Matrix types
  - 2D/3D Geometrix primitives
  - Geometric collision queries
  - Binary IO classes
  - A variety of container types implemented over a memory pool, including linked lists, dynamic arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, and AVL trees
